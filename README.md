# Min-sum algorithm algorithm for maximum-weight-matching problem.
Program for visualizing min-sum belief propagation algorithm in scope of Graphical Models course at Skoltech.

Algorithm is based on http://web.mit.edu/devavrat/www/maxprod-matching.pdf paper. Repository contains working implementations of both original and simlified versions of the algorithm.
Executable .jar file with instructions of how to run it can be downloaded using this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz7Svh1jQ-KAUno4TzFSN1IwQ3M).

Graph visualization uses [GraphStream library](http://graphstream-project.org) release 1.3.

Example of running program for a (7, 7) graph (since it is quite hard to depict all the 49 edges properly, at the end of animation I rearrange graph nodes a bit so it's easier to read).
